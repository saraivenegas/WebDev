            <h2>Leticia Fererra</h2>
            <p>
                Leticia found yoga on a whim thanks to a Friend’s gift of a free month of yoga. She went and was immediately hooked. One
                of the biggest benefits he received was being able to fully let go of her stressful workday through practice.
                “That was something I could not get doing other exercise activities. After just a couple of months I knew
                Yoga was something I wanted to have a bigger presence in my life. So I decided to become a teacher.” In Spring
                2014, Amy completed yoga Teacher Training.

            <h2>Kara Thorson</h2>
            <p>
                Kara is a Certified Yoga Teacher and Founder of The Little yoga Room in Montreal, has been practicing yoga since 1992 and
                strictly Vinyasa style for the last 12 years. She has studied in India with the top yogis. Yoga is really the art of waking up. Getting back to the true you. 
                It can be that simple. Yoga offers up a way for us to see a world that is working for you instead of against you.  Yoga reminds me that everything is connected so we must live, 
                act, dance, breathe with awareness. 
                If the journey really is the reward, then by golly I choose to enJOY the journey. I hope you will join me

            <h2>Alex Tomkins</h2>
            <p>
                Alex found yoga while she was struggling with depression. Yoga taught her to slow down and breathe, to take responsibility
                for her life, mindfulness, awareness, and self-love. She says, "It showed me that I created my own reality
                by choosing which thoughts and events I gave my life force and attention to. I was drawn to yoga for the
                philosophy side of things and my teaching is definitely influenced by that. I strongly believe that yoga
                is a spiritual practice; the physical benefits are just a byproduct. I am deeply passionate about introducing
                people to meditation as I believe there is nothing braver or sweeter than sitting with yourself in silence
                and stillness."
