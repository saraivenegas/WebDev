        <h1>Yoga Styles</h1>
        <p>We offer a variety of yoga styles to meet your needs on any given day. 
            Whether you want to unwind after a stressful day, or are looking for a challenge, there is something perfect for you!
        </p>
        <h2>Vinyasa</h2>
            <p>
            The term vinyasa refers to a specific series of movements that are frequently done between each 
            asana in a series. These days - the vinyasa is up to the yoga teacher.Vinyasa classes are often quite 
            dynamic, which requires the mind to stay focused in the present. The practice itself is like a moving meditation.
            The pace can vary and there is no one particular sequence that teachers follow.Most vinyasa yoga classes 
            begin with sun salutations - a sequence of postures done in succession. 
            Many Vinyasa Flow classes incorporate some kind of meditation before and/or after the class aswell.
            </p>
        <h2>Yin</h2>
            <p>A quiet, meditative yoga practice, also called taoist yoga. Yin focuses on lengthening connective tissues 
                and is meant to complement yang yoga—your muscle-forming Anusara, ashtanga, Iyengar, or what have you. 
                Yin poses are passive, meaning you’re supposed to relax muscles and let gravity do the work. 
                And they’re long — you’ll practice patience here too.
            </p>
        <h2>Kundalini</h2>
            <p>The practice of kundalini yoga features constantly moving, invigorating poses. 
                The fluidity of the practice is intended to release the kundalini (serpent) energy in your body. 
                Weren’t aware you had any? Well, just think of it as an energy supply, coiled like a sleeping snake at the
                base of the spine, waiting to be tapped; the practice aims to do just that — awaken and pulse the stuff upward through the body.
            </p>
        <h2>Hatha</h2>
            <p>By definition, hatha is a physical yoga practice, which is pretty much all yoga you’ll find in this hemisphere. 
                One of the six original branches of yoga, “hatha” encompasses nearly all types of modern yoga. 
                In other words, hatha is the ice cream if styles like ashtanga and Bikram are vanilla and chocolate chip. 
                Today, classes described as “hatha” on studio schedules are typically a basic 
                and classical approach to yogic breathing exercises and postures.
            </p>
        <h2>Ashtanga</h2>
            <p>Six established and strenuous pose sequences — the primary series, second series, third series, and so on — 
                practiced sequentially as progress is made. Ashtangis move rapidly, flowing from one pose to the 
                next with each inhale and exhale. Each series of poses linked by the breath this way is called a vinyasa.
