        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>
            We know that your world can sometimes be overwhelming. With the senses constantly bombarded, it's challenging to keep 
            your mind and body balanced and well.  You want to take more time for yourself, but you're not sure how to carve out the 
            time or where to start. You've heard about yoga and tried classes, but something's missing. 
            You crave more one on one attention, practical tools that can work for you off the mat, 
            and connection with your teacher and a community of like-minded people. 
            We are here to empower you with real connection, transformational tools, and a place to come 
            right in the Loop to take a deep breath. 
            Welcome to your new sanctuary, your quiet in the middle of the bustle. 
        </p>
